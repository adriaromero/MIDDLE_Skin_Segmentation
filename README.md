# SKIN LESION SEGMENTATION FROM DERMOSCOPIC IMAGES USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES

Authors: Jack Burdick, Adrià Romero López, Oge Marques

#Abstract
The recent emergence of deep learning methods for medical image analysis has enabled the development of intelligent medical imaging-based diagnosis systems that can assist the human expert in making better decisions about a patient’s health. In this project we focus on the problem of skin lesion segmentation and present a deep-learning based approach to solve the problem of segmentation.  The proposed solution is built around the U-Net convolutional neural network architecture.
